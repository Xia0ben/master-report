## Build

As all required source files and resources are in this repository, if you have a standard latex install, opening the "main.tex" file in your favorite editor should allow you to build it easily. Tested with the [Atom editor](https://atom.io/), using the [latex plugin] (https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex), which in turn used the [xelatex engine](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) and [dvipdfmx PDF Producer](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/dvipdfmx-def).

## TODO

### Medium priority

+ Adjust comparison criteria from newest observations brought by coding and the one already copied in chapter 2, "Determining appropriate comparison criteria" section, "Performance criteria"

### Low priority

+ Find a new title closer to final content, but keep the current title as subtitle might be relevant
+ Have the bibliography use numbers
+ Have the bibliography be ordered chronologically by date of publication
