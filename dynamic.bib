	abstract = {With the growing demand of personal assistance to mobility and mobile service robotics, robot navigation systems must be ??aware?? of the social conventions followed by people. They must respect proximity constraints but also respect people interacting. For example, they may not break interaction between people talking, unless the occupants want to take part in the conversation. In this case, they must be able to join the group using a socially adapted behavior. This paper proposes a risk-based navigation method including both the traditional notion of risk of collision and the notion of risk of disturbance. Results exhibit new emerging behavior showing how a robot takes into account social conventions in its navigation strategy.},

In order to do that we want to be able to predict their final goal and the trajectory they will follow to reach it. We attain this task borrowing from human science studies the concept of sub-goals, defined as points and landmarks of the environment towards which pedestrians walk or where they take directional choices before reaching the final destination. We retrieve the position of these sub-goals from the analysis of a large set of pedestrian trajectories in a shopping mall, and model their global behavior through transition probabilities between sub-goals. The method allows us to predict the future position of pedestrians on the basis of the observation of their trajectory up to the moment.},

In the last years human–robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.},

One of the main challenges, is to capture the transitions incurred by the human and further take into account robot constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel methodology that can instantiate diverse social spacing models depending on the context and further as a function of uncertainty and robot perception capacity. Our method is based on the use of non-stationary, skew-normal probability density functions for the space of individuals and on treating multi-person space interactions through social mapping. The utility of our approach is shown on an indoor robot operating in the presence of humans, allowing it to exhibit socially intelligent responses.},

Instead of treating persons as dynamic obstacles that should be avoided, here they are treated as special agents with an expert knowledge on navigating in dynamic scenarios. This work proposes that the robot selects and follows leaders, in order to move along optimal paths, deviate from undetected obstacles, improve navigation in densely populated areas and increase its acceptance by other humans. To accomplish this proposition, two novel approaches are developed in the area of leader selection. In the first, a motion prediction approach is used, to detect candidates that are moving to the same place that the robot is. In the second, a machine learning algorithm is trained with real examples and is used to select the best leader among several candidates. Experiments with a real robot are performed to validate the proposed approaches.},

	abstract = {An important challenge for autonomous robots is to navigate efficiently and safely in human populated environments. It requires that the robots perceive human motions and take into account human flows to plan and navigate. In this context we address the problem of modeling human flows from the perception of the robots, by defining a grid of the human motion likelihood over the environment, called flow grid. We define the computation of this grid as a counting based mapping. Then we define a path planning taking into account the risk of encountering humans in opposite direction. We first evaluate the approach in simulation by considering different navigation tasks in a crowded environment. For this purpose, we compare three A*-based path planning models using different levels of information about human presence. Simulations involving 200 moving persons and 4 collaborative robots allow to evaluate simultaneously the flow mapping and the related path planning efficiency. Finally we experiment the model with a real robot that maps human displacements in its environment.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse propose une méthode de navigation fondée sur les risques, y compris à la fois la notion traditionnelle de risque de collision et la notion de risque de perturbation. Avec la demande croissante d'assistance à la mobilité personnelle et de la robotique de services mobiles, les robots et les gens doivent partager les mêmes espaces physiques et suivre les mêmes conventions sociales. Les robots doivent respecter les contraintes de proximité, mais aussi respecter les gens qui interagissent. Par exemple, ils ne doivent pas briser l'interaction entre les gens qui parlent, à moins que la tâche du robot est de prendre part à la conversation. Dans ce cas, il doit être en mesure de rejoindre le groupe à l'aide d'un comportement socialement adapté. Le système de navigation socialement conscient proposée dans cette thèse intègre à la fois l'évaluation d'un risque de collision en utilisant des modèles prédictifs d'obstacles mobiles, et une évaluation de conformité avec les conventions sociales. La gestion humaine de l'espace (espace personnel, o-espace, espace d'activité ...) inspirée de la sociologie et la littérature robotique sociale est intégré, mais aussi des modèles de comportement qui permettent au robot la realisation de une prédiction à moyen terme des positions de l'homme. Les résultats de la simulation et des expériences sur un fauteuil roulant robotisé donnent validite a la méthode en montrant que notre robot est capable de naviguer dans un environnement dynamique en évitant les collisions avec des obstacles et des personnes et, en même temps, en réduisant l'inconfort chez les personnes en respectant les espaces mentionnés ci-dessus.},

	title = {Autonomous navigation in dynamic uncertain environment using probabilistic models of perception and collision risk prediction.},
	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00398055/document},
	abstract = {In this document we address the problem of autonomous navigation in dynamic unknown environ- ments. The key of the problem is to guarantee safety for all the agents moving in the space (people, vehicles and the robot itself) while moving toward a predefined goal. In contrast with static or controlled environments, high dynamic environments present many difficult issues: the detection and tracking of moving obstacles, the prediction of the future state of the world and the on-line motion planning and navigation. We moved our research starting from the fact that the decision about motion must take into account the limits of sensor perception, the velocity and future trajectory of the moving obstacles and that it must be related with the on-line updating of the world perception. Our approach is based on the use of probabilistic frameworks to represent the uncertainty about the static environment and the dynamic obstacles and we have developed decision methods that take explicitly into account such information for the autonomous navigation task. At first we focused our attention on reactive approaches. The developed approach is based on the integration between a probabilistic extension of the Velocity Obstacle framework within a dynamic occupancy grid (Bayesian Occupancy Filter). The dynamic occupancy grid gives a probabilistic and explicit representation of the perception limits and of the model error and noise while the Probabilistic Velocity Obstacles compute a probability of collision in time. The probability of collision and hence the choice of the next control, take into account limited sensor range, occlusions, obstacles shape and velocity estimation errors. Simulation results show the robot adapting its behaviour to different conditions of perception, avoiding static and moving obstacles and moving toward the goal. In the second part of the document we move toward more complex strategies, integrating a Partial Motion Planning algorithm with probabilistic representation of the environment and collision risk prediction. We propose a novel probabilistic extension of the well known Rapidly-exploring Random Trees framework and we integrate this search algorithm into a partial planning anytime approach, updating on-line the decisions of the robot with the last observations. We consider at first the case of a short-term prediction based on a classic Multi-Target-Tracking algorithm. Secondly, we consider the case of a longer term prediction based on a priori known typical patterns. We compare two kinds of patterns representation: the Hidden Markov Model representation and the continuous Gaussian Processes representation. The search and planning algorithm is adapted to these different kinds prediction and simulation results for navigation among multiple moving obstacles are shown.},

Human management of space (personal space, o-space, activity space...) inspired from sociology and social robotics literature is integrated, but also models of behavior that enable the robot to make medium-term prediction of the human positions. Simulation and experimental results on a robotic wheelchair validate the method by showing that our robot is able to navigate in a dynamic environment avoiding collisions with obstacles and people and, at the same time, minimizing discomfort in people by respecting spaces mentioned above.},
