\paragraph{} Re-reading the three papers about NAMO in unknown environments also offered the opportunity to reconsider three criteria for evaluating our experiment, in addition to the overall runtime:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The average number of obstacle evaluations: characterizes the gain of ordering candidate objects for evaluation.
  \item The average number of path planning algorithm calls: characterizes the gain of the choice of the bound during obstacle evaluation.
  \item The most efficient move/manipulation ratio: characterizes the density of the environment for which the algorithm gives the best performance.
\end{itemize}
