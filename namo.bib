	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01309950},
	abstract = {This paper presents a new geometrical formulation of the manipulation task planning problem in robotics. The problem is shown to be a constrained instance of the coordinated motion planning problem for multiple moving bodies. The constraints are related to the placement and the motion of objects, and can be expressed geometrically.

We give a general paradigm for building Manipulation Task Planners based on the proposed formulation. A manipulation task appears as a path in the configuration space of the robot and all movable objects. A \{{\textbackslash}em manipulation path\} is a sequence of constrained paths: \{{\textbackslash}em transit-paths\}, where the robot moves "alone'', and \{{\textbackslash}em transfer-paths\}, where the robot holds an object. The approach consists in building a \{{\textbackslash}em Manipulation Graph\} that models
the connectivity between certain regions in the global configuration space by transit-paths and transfer-paths.  

This approach is then applied to the case of a finite number of object placements and grasps. The nodes in the Manipulation Graph correspond to well identified configurations and the edges correspond to paths  built from a series of configuration space slices. An implemented system is presented and discussed.},

In such a workspace, the final positions of the movable obstacles may or may not be part of the goal. In the case where the final positions of the obstacles are specified, the general problem is shown to be {PSPACE}-hard. In the case where the final positions of the obstacles are unspecified, the motion planning problem is shown to be {NP}-hard.

We address an environment manipulation problem for a humanoid robot that finds a walking path from the given start location to the goal location while displacing obstructing objects on the walking path. This problem requires more complex configuration space than previous researches using a mobile robot especially in a manipulation phase, since a humanoid robot has many degrees of freedom in its arm than a forklift type robot. Our approach is to build environment manipulation task graph that decompose the given task into subtasks which are solved using navigation path planner or whole body motion planner. We also propose a standing location search and a displacing obstacle location search for connecting subtasks. Efficient method to solve manipulation planning that relies on whole body inverse kinematics and motion planning technology is also shown. Finally, we show experimental results in an environment with movable objects such as chairs and trash boxes. The planner finds an action sequence consists of walking paths and manipulating obstructing objects to walk from the start position to the goal position.},

	abstract = {Robots would be much more useful if they could move obstacles out of the way. Traditional
motion planning searches for collision free paths from a start to a goal.  However,  real
world search and rescue, construction, home and nursing home domains contain debris,
materials clutter, doors and objects that need to be moved by the robot.  Theoretically,
one can represent all possible interactions between the robot and movable objects as a
huge search.  We present methods that simplify the problem and make Navigation Among
Movable  Obstacles  ({NAMO})  a  practical  challenge  that  can  be  addressed  with  current
computers.
This thesis gives a full development cycle from motion planning to implementation on a
humanoid robot.  First, we devise a state space decomposition strategy that reasons about
free space connectivity to select objects and identify helpful displacements.  Second, we
present controls for balance and manipulation that allow the robot to move objects with
previously unknown dynamics.  Finally,  we combine these results in a complete system
that recognizes environment objects and executes Navigation Among Movable Obstacles.
Our continued work in {NAMO} planning has focused on three topics:  reasoning about
object interaction, three dimensional manipulation and interaction with constrained ob-
jects.  This thesis presents the computational and theoretical challenges that arise from
these elaborations of the {NAMO} domain.  In each case we introduce extensions to our
algorithms that respond to the challenge and evaluate their performance in simulation.
All the methods presented in this thesis not only solve previously unsolved problems but
also operate efficiently, giving real-time results that can be used during online operation.},

	abstract = {To accomplish a task an autonomous robot must break this task into “primitive ” subtasks and order them to satisfy precedence constraints. Each subtask requires performing a motion. The existence of a feasible trajectory is an additional precondition for the subtask, but a very expensive one to test. Probabilistic {RoadMaps} ({PRM}) are an effective approach to plan feasible trajectories when these exist. However, {PRM} planners are unable to detect that no solution exists. On the other hand, a task/motion planner must often consider many subtasks, a fraction of which, only, admit feasible trajectories. This paper proposes a general algorithm (I‐{TMP}) that specifically addresses this issue. This algorithm interweaves task and motion planning, and allows distributing computational effort where it is most useful. It is probabilistically complete in the following sense: if I‐{TMP} can generate a sequence of subtasks that admits a feasible trajectory, such a trajectory will eventually be found with high probability. An application of I‐{TMP} to multi-limbed robots navigating on rough terrain is presented. I.},

	abstract = {Research on humanoid robots has been mostly with the aim of developing robots that can replace humans in the performance of certain tasks. Motion planning for these robots can be quite difficult, due to their complex kinematics, dynamics and environment. It is consequently one of the key research topics in humanoid robotics research and the last few years have witnessed considerable progress in the field. Motion Planning for Humanoid Robots surveys the remarkable recent advancement in both the theoretical and the practical aspects of humanoid motion planning. Various motion planning frameworks are presented in Motion Planning for Humanoid Robots, including one for skill coordination and learning, and one for manipulating and grasping tasks. The problem of planning sequences of contacts that support acyclic motion in a highly constrained environment is addressed and a motion planner that enables a humanoid robot to push an object to a desired location on a cluttered table is described. The main areas of interest include: • whole body motion planning, • task planning, • biped gait planning, and • sensor feedback for motion planning. Torque-level control of multi-contact behavior, autonomous manipulation of moving obstacles, and movement control and planning architecture are also covered. Motion Planning for Humanoid Robots will help readers to understand the current research on humanoid motion planning. It is written for industrial engineers, advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students.},

Movable obstacles are detected using active sensing and a color range sensor, and when an obstacle is moved, the perception of the environment is reconstructed. Active sensing is defined as the classification of an object as either movable or static after the robot tries to push the object using its arm. This classification is collectively based on force sensor inputs, joint angles, and color range sensor inputs. In order to gather information from the environment, we use a color range sensor consisting of a {TOF} (Time of Flight) range sensor and conventional stereo cameras. Finally, we show experimental result in the environment with movable obstacles such as a table and chairs. Humanoid robot {HRP}-2 detects that a chair is a movable obstacle, moves the chair to clear a path to its goal, and then reaches the goal.},

The presented algorithm can detect openings for obstacles of arbitrary shapes being displaced in arbitrary directions in changing environments. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first algorithm to achieve efficient opening detection for arbitrary shaped obstacles.},

The input descriptions will specify what the user wants done rather than how to do it. The robots will be any kind of versatile mechanical device equipped with actuators and sensors under the control of a computing system. Making progress toward autonomous robots is of major practical inter est in a wide variety of application domains including manufacturing, construction, waste management, space exploration, undersea work, as sistance for the disabled, and medical surgery. It is also of great technical interest, especially for Computer Science, because it raises challenging and rich computational issues from which new concepts of broad useful ness are likely to emerge. Developing the technologies necessary for autonomous robots is a formidable undertaking with deep interweaved ramifications in auto mated reasoning, perception and control. It raises many important prob lems. One of them - motion planning - is the central theme of this book. It can be loosely stated as follows: How can a robot decide what motions to perform in order to achieve goal arrangements of physical objects? This capability is eminently necessary since, by definition, a robot accomplishes tasks by moving in the real world. The minimum one would expect from an autonomous robot is the ability to plan its x Preface own motions.},

Doing so enables our approach to directly build on, and benefit from, the vast literature and latest advances in task planning and motion planning. It uses a novel representational abstraction and requires only that failures in computing a motion plan for a high-level action be identifiable and expressible in the form of logical predicates at the task level.

With deeper understanding of the environments, robotic navigation in cluttered environments filled with movable obstacles is improved. Scene understanding and object detection are achieved by our state-of-the-art Convolu-tional Neural Network ({CNN}) with multi-functions and then transformed into robotic beliefs using Bayes filtering to ensure temporal coherence. Object beliefs are further extended from 2D to 3D space with geometric feature detection and used for semantic mapping together with scene beliefs. Planning algorithm is designed to utilize semantic beliefs to create path through cluttered environments by manipulating movable obstacles at minimal costs. We evaluate the system on our robots with real human-living office scenarios.},

The environment is represented by an evidence grid, where each cell contains a gamma-distributed cost as well as visual feature data in the form of a color histogram. While navigating, the robot associates visual features of objects occupying a given cell with manipulability cost estimates of that cell, learning whether an object or obstacle can be moved or not in the robot's attempt to reach the goal. We derive and utilize a lower confidence bound ({LCB}) estimate for the cost of each cell in order to incorporate an exploration (versus pure exploitation) element to the robot's search for the lowest-cost path. Combining the {LCB} cost estimates with the dynamic replanning search algorithm D*-Lite, we can quickly compute optimal navigation paths regardless of the numerous changes occurring in the robot's environmental belief state. We explain the probabilistic representation of cost in the evidence grid and provide simulation and real-world results for our algorithm in a navigation scenario with static and movable objects.},

We present an algorithm that, with no prior knowledge of the environment, allows a mobile robot to determine which obstacles are movable and which are not while navigating a cluttered environment. The algorithm also applies this knowledge of manipulability to obstacles encountered in the future that are similar in appearance to ones previously seen.

	title = {Cognitive Task Planning for Smart Industrial Robots},
	url = {http://paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it/9784/},
	abstract = {This research work presents a novel Cognitive Task Planning framework for Smart Industrial Robots. The framework makes an industrial mobile manipulator robot Cognitive by applying Semantic Web Technologies. It also introduces a novel Navigation Among Movable Obstacles algorithm for robots navigating and manipulating inside a ﬁrm. 

The objective of Industrie 4.0 is the creation of Smart Factories: modular ﬁrms provided with cyber-physical systems able to strong customize products under the condition of highly ﬂexible mass-production. Such systems should real-time communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans via the Internet of Things. They should intelligently adapt to the changing surroundings and autonomously navigate inside a ﬁrm while moving obstacles that occlude free paths, even if seen for the ﬁrst time. At the end, in order to accomplish all these tasks while being eﬃcient, they should learn from their actions and from that of other agents. 

Most of existing industrial mobile robots navigate along pre-generated trajectories. They follow ectriﬁed wires embedded in the ground or lines painted on th eﬂoor. When there is no expectation of environment changes and cycle times are critical, this planning is functional. When workspaces and tasks change frequently, it is better to plan dynamically: robots should autonomously navigate without relying on modiﬁcations of their environments. Consider the human behavior: humans reason about the environment and consider the possibility of moving obstacles if a certain goal cannot be reached or if moving objects may signiﬁcantly shorten the path to it. This problem is named Navigation Among Movable Obstacles and is mostly known in rescue robotics. This work transposes the problem on an industrial scenario and tries to deal with its two challenges: the high dimensionality of the state space and the treatment of uncertainty. 

The proposed {NAMO} algorithm aims to focus exploration on less explored areas. For this reason it extends the Kinodynamic Motion Planning by Interior-Exterior Cell Exploration algorithm. The extension does not impose obstacles avoidance: it assigns an importance to each cell by combining the eﬀorts necessary to reach it and that needed to free it from obstacles. The obtained algorithm is scalable because of its independence from the size of the map and from the number, shape, and pose of obstacles. It does not impose restrictions on actions to be performed: the robot can both push and grasp every object. Currently, the algorithm assumes full world knowledge but the environment is reconﬁgurable and the algorithm can be easily extended in order to solve {NAMO} problems in unknown environments. The algorithm handles sensor feedbacks and corrects uncertainties. 

Usually Robotics separates Motion Planning and Manipulation problems. {NAMO} forces their combined processing by introducing the need of manipulating multiple objects, often unknown, while navigating. Adopting standard precomputed grasps is not suﬃcient to deal with the big amount of existing diﬀerent objects. A Semantic Knowledge Framework is proposed in support of the proposed algorithm by giving robots the ability to learn to manipulate objects and disseminate the information gained during the fulﬁllment of tasks. The Framework is composed by an Ontology and an Engine. The Ontology extends the {IEEE} Standard Ontologies for Robotics and Automation and contains descriptions of learned manipulation tasks and detected objects. It is accessible from any robot connected to the Cloud. It can be considered a data store for the eﬃcient and reliable execution of repetitive tasks; and a Web-based repository for the exchange of information between robots and for the speed up of the learning phase. No other manipulation ontology exists respecting the {IEEE} Standard and, regardless the standard, the proposed ontology diﬀers from the existing ones because of the type of features saved and the eﬃcient way in which they can be accessed: through a super fast Cascade Hashing algorithm. The Engine lets compute and store the manipulation actions when not present in the Ontology. It is based on Reinforcement Learning techniques that avoid massive trainings on large-scale databases and favors human-robot interactions. 

The overall system is ﬂexible and easily adaptable to diﬀerent robots operating in diﬀerent industrial environments. It is characterized by a modular structure where each software block is completely reusable. Every block is based on the open-source Robot Operating System. Not all industrial robot controllers are designed to be {ROS}-compliant. This thesis presents the method adopted during this research in order to Open Industrial Robot Controllers and create a {ROS}-Industrial interface for them.},

	abstract = {This thesis tackles the manipulation planning for documented objects. The difficulty of the problem is the coupling of a symbolic and a geometrical problem. Classical approaches combine task and motion planning. They are hard to implement and time consuming. This approach is different on three aspects. The first aspect is a theoretical framework to model admissible motions of the robot and objects. This model uses constraints to link symbolic task and motions achieving such task. A graph of constraint models the manipulation rules. A planning algorithm using this graph is proposed. The second aspect is the handling of constrained motion. In manipulation planning, an abstract definition of numerical constraint is necessary. A continuity criterion for Newton-Raphson methods is proposed to ensure the continuity of trajectories in sub-manifolds. The last aspect is object documentation. Some information, easy to define for human beings, greatly speeds up the search. This documentation, specific to each object and end-effector, is used to generate a graph of constraint, easing the problem specification and resolution.},

Unlike most of the existing approaches that replan a path only when it becomes unfeasible (e.g., no collision-free paths exist), the proposed algorithm takes into consideration a replanning procedure whenever an effort-saving is possible. The effort is here considered as the execution time, but it is extensible to the robot energy consumption. The computed plan is both conditional and dynamically adaptable to the unexpected environmental changes. Based on the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, authors expect their proposal to be complete and scalable. In progress experiments aim to prove this investigation.},
