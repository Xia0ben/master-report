	abstract = {Changing demands in society and the limited capabilities of health systems have paved the way for robots to move out of industrial contexts and enter more human-centered environments such as health care. We explore the shared beliefs and concerns of health workers on the introduction of autonomously operating service robots in hospitals or professional care facilities. By means of Q-methodology, a mixed research approach specifically designed for studying subjective thought patterns, we identify five potential end-user niches, each of which perceives different affordances and outcomes from using service robots in their working environment. Our findings allow for better understanding resistance and susceptibility of different users in a hospital and encourage managerial awareness of varying demands, needs, and surrounding conditions that a service robot must contend with. We also discuss general insights into presenting the Q-methodology results and how an affordance-based view could inform the adoption, appropriation, and adaptation of emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {Technical aids allow elderly and handicapped people to live independently and supported in their private homes for a longer time. As a contribution to such technological solutions, two demonstrator platforms for a robotic home assistant—called Care-O-bot—were designed and implemented at Fraunhofer {IPA}, Stuttgart. Whereas Care-O-bot I is only a mobile platform with a touch screen, Care-O-bot {II} is additionally equipped with adjustable walking supporters and a manipulator arm. It has the capability to navigate autonomously in indoor environments, be used as an intelligent walking support, and execute manipulation tasks. The control software of Care-O-bot {II} runs on two industrial {PCs} and a hand-held control panel. The walking aid module is based on sensors in the walking aid handles and on a dynamic model of conventional walking aids. In “direct mode”, the user can move along freely with the robot whereas obstacles are detected and avoided. In “planned mode”, he can specify a target and be lead there by the robotic assistant. Autonomous planning and execution of complex manipulation tasks is based on a symbolic planner and environmental information provided in a database. The user input (graphical and speech input) is transferred to the task planner and adequate actions to solve the task (sequence of motion and manipulation commands) are created. A new method for sensor based manipulation using a tilting laser scanner and camera integrated in the head of the robot has been implemented. Additional sensors in the robot hand increase the grasping capabilities. The walking aid has been tested with elderly users from an assisted living facility and a nursery home. Furthermore, the execution of fetch and carry tasks has been implemented and tested in a sample home environment.},

	abstract = {Mobile robots often operate in domains that are only incompletely known, for example, when they have to move from given start coordinates to given goal coordinates in unknown terrain. In this case, they need to be able to replan quickly as their knowledge of the terrain changes. Stentz' Focussed Dynamic A/sup */ (D/sup */) is a heuristic search method that repeatedly determines a shortest path from the current robot coordinates to the goal coordinates while the robot moves along the path. It is able to replan faster than planning from scratch since it modifies its previous search results locally. Consequently, it has been extensively used in mobile robotics. In this article, we introduce an alternative to D/sup */ that determines the same paths and thus moves the robot in the same way but is algorithmically different. D/sup */ Lite is simple, can be rigorously analyzed, extendible in multiple ways, and is at least as efficient as D/sup */. We believe that our results will make D/sup */-like replanning methods even more popular and enable robotics researchers to adapt them to additional applications.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139350},
	abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic framework for synthesizing control policies for general multi-robot systems that is based on decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-{POMDPs}). Dec-{POMDPs} are a general model of decision-making where a team of agents must cooperate to optimize a shared objective in the presence of uncertainty. Dec-{POMDPs} also consider communication limitations, so execution is decentralized. While Dec-{POMDPs} are typically intractable to solve for real-world problems, recent research on the use of macro-actions in Dec-{POMDPs} has significantly increased the size of problem that can be practically solved. We show that, in contrast to most existing methods that are specialized to a particular problem class, our approach can synthesize control policies that exploit any opportunities for coordination that are present in the problem, while balancing uncertainty, sensor information, and information about other agents. We use three variants of a warehouse task to show that a single planner of this type can generate cooperative behavior using task allocation, direct communication, and signaling, as appropriate. This demonstrates that our algorithmic framework can automatically optimize control and communication policies for complex multi-robot systems.},

	abstract = {We introduce {YOLO}9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the {YOLO} detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, {YOLOv}2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like {PASCAL} {VOC} and {COCO}. At 67 {FPS}, {YOLOv}2 gets 76.8 {mAP} on {VOC} 2007. At 40 {FPS}, {YOLOv}2 gets 78.6 {mAP}, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster {RCNN} with {ResNet} and {SSD} while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train {YOLO}9000 simultaneously on the {COCO} detection dataset and the {ImageNet} classification dataset. Our joint training allows {YOLO}9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the {ImageNet} detection task. {YOLO}9000 gets 19.7 {mAP} on the {ImageNet} detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in {COCO}, {YOLO}9000 gets 16.0 {mAP}. But {YOLO} can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

	doi = {10.1109/IROS.2010.5654369},
	shorttitle = {Unfreezing the robot},
	abstract = {In this paper, we study the safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents with uncertain trajectories. Existing algorithms suffer from the “freezing robot” problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in “joint collision avoidance”: They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop {IGP}, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably.},
